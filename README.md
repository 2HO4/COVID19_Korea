# COVID-19 Data Science Project: Analysis of COVID-19 in Korea

## Introduction
This data science project focuses on analyzing the COVID-19 patient-level data of South Korea to prepare the country for the next wave of the pandemic. The project aims to extract critical insights from various datasets and present them to the country's leadership to formulate an effective plan to fight the pandemic.

## Dataset Overview
The project utilizes several datasets related to COVID-19 in South Korea. The datasets include:
1. Case Data: Provides information about COVID-19 infection cases in South Korea.
2. Patient Data: Contains epidemiological data of COVID-19 patients in South Korea.
3. Time Series Data: Consists of time series data on COVID-19 status, including age, gender, and province.
4. Additional Data: Includes location and statistical data of regions in South Korea, weather data, search trend data, floating population data, and government policy data.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the provided datasets and derive meaningful insights to help in the fight against the pandemic. By leveraging data science techniques and methodologies, I aim to:
1. Understand the patterns and characteristics of COVID-19 infection cases in South Korea.
2. Identify trends and patterns in the spread of the virus over time, considering age, gender, and geographical factors.
3. Analyze the impact of government policies and interventions on controlling the pandemic.
4. Explore the relationship between weather conditions and the spread of COVID-19.
5. Investigate the public's search trends and their correlation with the progression of the pandemic.
6. Study the movement patterns of the floating population and its influence on the spread of the virus.

## Methodology
The project will involve the following steps:
1. Data Acquisition: Gathering and collecting the required datasets related to COVID-19 in South Korea from the [Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC)](https://www.kdca.go.kr/)  and the local governments. Thank you to the members of the DS4C Project for organizing the data ([Github](https://github.com/ThisIsIsaac/Data-Science-for-COVID-19)).
2. Data Preparation: Cleaning, preprocessing, and organizing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducting thorough exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the datasets.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate the findings.
Reporting and Presentation: Summarizing the findings, implications, and recommendations in a comprehensive report.

## Project Deliverables
The project will deliver the following:
1. Detailed analysis report: A comprehensive report highlighting the insights, findings, and implications from the analysis of COVID-19 data in South Korea.
2. Visualizations: Clear and informative visualizations, including charts, graphs, and maps, to aid in understanding the data.
3. Recommendations: Actionable recommendations for policymakers and healthcare professionals to effectively combat the pandemic.
4. Code Repository: A well-documented code repository containing the scripts, notebooks, and data preprocessing steps used in the analysis.

## Conclusion
Through this data science project, I aim to provide valuable insights and recommendations based on the analysis of COVID-19 data in South Korea. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we can help the world make informed decisions and implement effective strategies to combat the pandemic and safeguard public health.
